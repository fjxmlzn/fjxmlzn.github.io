<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>The Goodgrant Foundation intends to donate a total of \$100,000,000 to some selected U.S. educational institutions annually for five years. They want to know the optimal investment strategy and its return on investment (ROI).</p>

<p>In the first step, we propose two kinds of donation&ndash;donation for academic facilities’improvement and donation as student grant. To evaluate the effect of the first kind of donation, we propose several models. We first calculate the best Gaussian distribution to describe students&rsquo; ability before entering school and after leaving school. Through these two values, we gain two parameters which define school&rsquo;s effect on students. By comparing the real students&rsquo; performance with expected performance when the same students entering an &ldquo;average school&rdquo;, we obtain Relative Institution Quality (RIQ) which evaluates school education quality. The calculation involves Gaussian Distance Measurement (GDM) which has beautiful mathematical form. We utilize mutual information to evaluate RIQ and prove that it has good performance. Furthermore, the top five school which has extremely high RIQ are Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University and Georgetown University. It proves that our model conforms to reality well. Then, we use neural network model to calculate the ROI value when donation amount changes. We use piece wise linear function to evaluate the second kind of donation. Finally, we unify these two evaluation functions and give the ROI representation. We optimize the proportion of two kinds of donation in order to maximize the final ROI value in a school.</p>

<p>In the second step, we strictly prove it to be a Strict Non-Deterministic Polynomial Complete (S-NPC) problem, which means it is almost impossible to solve it in affordable time. Thus, we introduce greedy algorithm and dynamic programming strategy and propose a novel algorithm to get an approximate optimal solution. The algorithm reduces the time complexity of the problem essentially and has good performance according to simulation.</p>

<p>Because there are much missing data, and some of them are important when doing manual analysis, we utilize Gaussian Mixture Models to predict some of them.</p>

<h1 id="background">Background</h1>

<p>This was a work posted for Problem C in <a href="http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/contests/2016/problems/" target="_blank">COMAP’s 2016 Mathematical Contest in Modeling</a>. The original problem was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Goodgrant Foundation is a charitable organization that wants to help improve educational performance of undergraduates attending colleges and universities in the United States. To do this, the foundation intends to donate a total of $100,000,000 (US100 million) to an appropriate group of
schools per year, for five years, starting July 2016. In doing so, they do not want to duplicate the investments and focus of other large grant organizations such as the Gates Foundation and Lumina Foundation.
Your team has been asked by the Goodgrant Foundation to develop a model to determine an optimal investment strategy that identifies the schools, the investment amount per school, the return on that investment, and the time duration that the organization’s money should be provided to have the
highest likelihood of producing a strong positive effect on student performance. This strategy should contain a 1 to N optimized and prioritized candidate list of schools you are recommending for investment based on each candidate school’s demonstrated potential for effective use of private funding, and an estimated return on investment (ROI) defined in a manner appropriate for a charitable organization such as the Goodgrant Foundation.</p>

<p>To assist your effort, the attached data file (ProblemCDATA.zip) contains information extracted from the U.S. National Center on Education Statistics (www.nces.ed.gov/ipeds), which maintains an extensive database of survey information on nearly all post-secondary colleges and universities in the United States, and the College Scorecard data set (<a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov">https://collegescorecard.ed.gov</a>) which contains various institutional performance data. Your model and subsequent strategy must be based on some
meaningful and defendable subset of these two data sets.</p>

<p>In addition to the required one-page summary for your MCM submission, your report must include a letter to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the Goodgrant Foundation, Mr. Alpha Chiang, that describes the optimal investment strategy, your modeling approach and major results, and a brief
discussion of your proposed concept of a return-on-investment (ROI) that the Goodgrant Foundation should adopt for assessing the 2016 donation(s) and future philanthropic educational investments within the United States. This letter should be no more than two pages in length.</p>

<p>Zinan Lin solved the the second step (Section 4 in the paper) and part of the first step (Section 3.2.2 &amp; 3.2.3 &amp; 3.3 &amp; 3.4 in the paper) of the problem. Xingyu Jing solved the rest part of first step (Section 3.2.4 &amp; 3.2.5 in the paper). Shengjie Lin did the data preprocessing (Section 2 in the paper) and wrote the non-technical letter of the study (Appendix A in the paper).</p>
